# CS630-Visualizer

# Description

This project is a visualization of the 7 state process model. The project consists of a web app that lets you create a number of processes and configure general parameters for the simulation itself. The visualization will then run and showcase the processes moving from one state to another, going all the way from NEW ro EXIT.

In order to use this project, you must have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the following link: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Setup

### Client

- Enter the client directory: `cd client`
- Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

- Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

- Start the frontend server:

```bash
npm run preview
```

The frontend server should now be running on `http://localhost:4173/`

The server will be running in the terminal window so you will need to open a new terminal window to run the backend.

### Backend

Enter the backend directory: `cd backend`

This project consists of a Python backend using the Flask framework In order to use this framework with the front end, you must use a virtual environment. **NOTE**: This step is not mandatory for Mac/Linux users.

- To create virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`

To activate virtual environment:

**Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`

**Linux/MacOS**: `source venv/bin/activate`

- Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Start the backend server:

```bash
python3 app.py
